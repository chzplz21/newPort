			Rothkopf Web Works
			</h1>
			<p>
			Hey! My name is David Rothkopf and I am a PHP/JavaScript web developer living in South Florida. My professional experience includes working for a legal
			services company called	Agency for Civil Enforcement where I developed and maintained a custom MVC Framework written in PHP 
			and MySQL. I have also worked for a Web Development company called Sleon Productions where I was the sole developer on projects 
			including Wordpress websites for the Miami International Airport and the National Children's Center, an organization based in 
			Washington DC. 
			<br>
			<br>
			On the back end, I am proficient in writing clean, maintainable, Object Oriented PHP. I have worked a lot with Laravel and can
			adapt to other PHP frameworks. The progamming mantra, "DRY", Don't Repeat Yourself, is something I religously adhere to.
			<br>
			<br>
			On the front end, I am adept at  working within the DOM with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery. I'm knowledgeble within WordPress as all projects I did with 
			Sleon Productions were within the WordPress platform. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm very easy to get along with and I have a BA in Philosophy from UCF. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In my free time I'm into playing/making music, going on bike rides, and have recently gotten into Poi (Spinning balls attached to ropes). I just like to hang out too, it's cool.
