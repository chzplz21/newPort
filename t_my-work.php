		<h1 class = "webTitle">Miami International Airport Holiday Coupons</h1>
		While working for Sleon Productions, I was tasked with developing an application 
		for the Miami International Airport which would allow shoppers to print out, as well 
		as use their phones to display coupons throughout the airport during the holiday season. 
		The site utitlizes Javascript browser cacheing capabilities, allowing users to click on as many 
		coupons as they like, save them, and print them out. Alternatively they can just use their phones 
		to show their saved coupons. Also, this application allows users to filter their coupon search by airport terminal and store type.

		<h1 class = "webTitle">Suite of Legal Service Web Apps utilizing a common custom MVC Framework</h1>
		While working for A.C.E. Inc, a private legal process serving company based in South Florida, I 
		developed a suite of web apps which utilized a common, custom PHP MVC framework.
		<br><br>

		Each of the web sites listed to the left instantiate a unique Class and unique MySQL table. Each of those Classes inherit 
		from a common Parent Class, forming the backbone of the framework. 
		<br><br>
		The main search field on the landing page uses the JQuery UI plugin. The search input is passed to the backend where the DB contains
		a record for every city, state, and county in America. From there users can navigate to

		<h1 class = "webTitle">Repoisitory.com built with Laravel</h1>
		Repoisitory.com is a site I made with Laravel with the mission of centralizing Youtube video tutorials on Poi tricks.
		If you've never heard of Poi,  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifj-uDY7Kbc" target = "blank">here's a cool video of a guy doing it. </a> I'm not a fraction
		as good as that dude, by the way. And I have yet to spin actual fire.
		<br><br>
		Anyway, what's happening in this app is that when a user clicks on a link for a particular trick, that trick name is added to the URL.
		An Eloquent Query is made based on the trick name, and all trick videos with that name are fetched from the DB. Nothing too
		crazy here.
